# Weekly Ghidra Build

An automated weekly build of Ghidra from the main branch of the [official repo](https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra).  I wrote this because some features are held from the offical Ghidra release for months at a time (looking at you, debugger and dark mode)

To get the latest verison, download the zip from the releases.
